# ðŸ§  Bloch Sphere Simulator (1-Qubit)

Welcome to the **Bloch Sphere Simulator**, a tool designed to help visualize how single-qubit quantum gates affect the state of a qubit on the Bloch Sphere.

## ðŸ§ª What This Project Does

This project simulates the evolution of a **single qubit** using the **Bloch Sphere**, a geometric representation of quantum states. You'll be able to:

- Input **various single-qubit gates** (e.g., X, Y, Z, H, S, T, Rx, Ry, Rz)
- Observe how these gates **transform the qubit state**
- **Visualize** the resulting qubit state on the Bloch Sphere in real-time or step-by-step

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Provide an **interactive and visual** tool for understanding quantum gates
- Reinforce **intuitive understanding** of qubit transformations
- Support **custom gate sequences** to see cumulative effects

## ðŸš€ Future Features

- Step-through simulation of multiple gates
- Live animation of state transitions
- Save and export gate sequences
- Expand to include noise models or measurement simulation

## ðŸ§  Why Use This?

Quantum computing is hard to visualize, especially when learning how quantum gates manipulate states. This project gives a **hands-on, visual explanation** of core quantum concepts in a way that's easy to grasp.
